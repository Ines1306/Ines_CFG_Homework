"""
Question 1
"""

"""
It is a recursive structure where hierarchical structure made up of root at the top and descending 
nodes organised in subtree(s), with nodes being described in relative terms as 'parent' nodes to the 
nodes below them and 'child' nodes to the nodes above them.
or - topics:
Root node, acyclic, connected and undirected (?)
"""

"""
Question 2
"""

"""
It's a tree whose nodes have up to k child-nodes.
"""

"""
Question 3
"""

"""
Each lookup is fast because it can narrow down the search by excluding half the remaining
tree each node it reaches.
or - topics
Balanced and makes searching more efficiently because the search/work is split evently
"""

"""
Question 4
"""

"""
This tree would be the most inefficient because it is linear and we cannot divide the work.
