Question 1
"""

"""
Hashing is a process to transform an input into a sequence of numbers.
or
It is a function/algorith that match data to an integer value
"""

"""
Question 2
"""

"""
A hash table has to support insertion (of a key-value pair), deletion (of a key-value pair)
and lookup (of the value associated with the key in the hash table).
"""

"""
Question 3
"""

"""
It is called hash collision.
"""

"""
Question 4
"""

"""
To deal with hash collision we can:
1. make each array slot hold a pointer to a linked list that has the values of all keys in that index
2. if the initial index already has a value, the next slot is checked until an empty one is found
or
chaining and open-addressing (what I described above)
